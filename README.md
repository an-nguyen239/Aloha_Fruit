# See Fruit
Aloha Fruit is an iOS app that displays an Augmented Reality descriptions and models of an object. 

The main purpose of our team is to develop an app that makes education more appealing and interesting for children. We want to create a fun and high-tech learning tool for them to explore the surrounding environment while enjoying the fresh air outside. 

## How this works
 The app automatically detects a surface to launch an AR plane anchor. Based on this anchor, an AR model will be rendered with high precision of detail and location. By identify a solid point in a space, we are able to keep the model in place regardless of any motion. 


Children are able to examine the fruit closely by moving the camera closer to the object without any distort or blurring. 

Our info is also really funny btw (:
